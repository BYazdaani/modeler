# Bpmn Modeler Application

Bpmn Modeler is used to create Business Process Model and Notation(BPMN). The goal is to provides users a graphical notation for specifying Business Process Modeling while adhering to it's specifications. These diagrams are visualized with XML languages and designed for the execution of business processes.

- Bpmn Modeler is built using [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

- [JointJs]((https://www.jointjs.com/opensource) ) is used to create fully interactive BPMN processes

- [Cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell) for End-to-end tests

- [bpmn-moddle](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-moddle) allows the modeler to read and white BPMN 2.0 diagram files in NodeJS and the browser
